# 🧠 Borys' School Projects Showcase

Hi! I’m Borys — a second-year software engineering student based in Amsterdam, with a strong passion for frontend development, design, and user-focused functionality. This repo is a curated collection of projects I’ve built during school and in my free time. Each one taught me something new — whether it was about design systems, backend logic, or building a better user experience.

All of these projects were built from scratch, without templates or generators — just code, curiosity, and a lot of iteration.
